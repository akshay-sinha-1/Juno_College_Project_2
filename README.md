Project 2: Responsive design conversion project
For this project, I am given the task of building a site from one of the provided designs below. This project is meant to call upon everything the course has covered. 

This project must be responsive, meaning it should work on smaller screen sizes, with the smallest screen size being around 320px in width.

Browse the designs below and when you find one that speaks to you, get started building your site! Each project comes with a desktop and mobile design along with assets.
